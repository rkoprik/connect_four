Connect Four game in R language

This is the game Connect Four in R language. 

The game Connect Four is played by two people (or one vs. computer), who take turns dropping one disc (each player has
a diferent color) from the top into a vertically suspended grid (usually 6x7, but can be chosen). The pieces fall straight
down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the
first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs. The game ends in a tie,
if there is no free cell left and none of the players has a line of four.
